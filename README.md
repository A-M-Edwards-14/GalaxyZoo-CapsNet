## Project Overview
This project investigated the relative abilities of a capsule network and residual network to reproduce the human classifications of galaxy images. This repository provides code that can train both models, evaluate their classification accuracies and test their abilities to reproduce well known physical results related to galaxy evolution.
	
## Required Packages and Technologies
Project is created with:
* Pytorch
* CUDA
* Torchvision
* Pandas
* ETC
